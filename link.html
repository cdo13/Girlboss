        <p>The purpose of this blog is to create a safe space in the internet for young Black girls and women to use and prosper in the greater Pittsburgh region. 
          As a rising sophomore at the University of Pittsburgh, I experienced a new community coming into a new environment. As a freshman, we would be immersed in the activities of orientation week or “O-week”, I met many friends of different backgrounds however most of the friends I made were Black girls and boys. The University of Pittsburgh is indeed a PWI (Predominantly White Institution) so there were very few of us freshmen, so I and my new friends will try to look for clubs that benefited our interests, but at the time period, it was so difficult to even find clubs that focused on our interests talk less of clubs and organizations focused on Black empowerment.
